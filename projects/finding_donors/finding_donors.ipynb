    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

However, they are often prone to overfitting so we should make sure to tune their parameters with a train/test split method. These models are used in apps recommandation for instance, but are suitable for many other tasks. It would certainly be a great candidate here due to the possibly complex relations between the variables and the income.\n",

One of the main advantages of this method is that these classifiers generally don't overfit if the weak learner does not do so. Boosting methods are knows to produce some of the best results in supervised learning: XGBoost for instance, which is a gradient boosting method, is often used to win data science competitions on Kaggle. They can be used to solve a large range of problems, from finding new customers to detect potential deseases. However, even if we use a tree classifier, we will not be able to plot a decision tree.

    "We just compared the performances of three different algorithms: A Support Vector Machine Classifier, a AdaBoost classifier with a tree as a weak learner, and a Decision Tree Classifier.\n",
    "First of all, these models do great on the learning set. That means that their are complex enough to understand the data. If we used logistic regression for instance, we would have seen a poorer performance on the training set, due to the impossibility of this model to understand non linear effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models, if we don't tune parameters, react differently to overfitting. The DecisionTreeClassifier clearly overfit the data, and is able to predict perfectly the training set for sizes 1% and 10%, and nearly perfect for the whole training set. However, it is not a \"bad\" overfitting, because this model do quite good on the test set for both metrics. This simply means that we could tune this model to do a little worst on the training set and a little better on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the test set, these models all do a better job than the naive classifier, and have similar performances. We will rule out the SVM classifier because of its learning time, which as expected is a lot worst than the one of the booosting and the tree classifiers. Because of this long learning time, we will not be able to tune precisely this model using a grid search (not to mention a K-fold validation would make this a lot worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given only these results, we could choose either the AdaBoost classifier of the Decision tree one. They do quite the same on the test set for the objective metric (the Adaboost do a little better because the Decision Tree overfit, which could be corrected with parameters tuning). In addition to that, they are quick to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will choose the AdaBoost classifier, because we will not have to deal with overfitting (boosting classifiers generally don't overfit), and because it does a little better on the test set when trained whith the whole training set. In addition to this, this model is able to deal with the numerical and the categorical features of this dataset.\n",

    "This model is able to combine several small decision rules into a more efficient one. Suppose that we know some small rules that will help us predict if one individual have an income greater than 50K. For instance, a person older than 40 is more likely to make more than 50K, compared to a younger person. We can also think that a person who works more than 50 hours per week is more likely to earn more money. This algorithm is able, by looking at some examples, to find some small rules like this and combine them into an efficient rule to detect who would be more likely to earn more than 50K.\n",

    "Capital-gain is indeed the most important feature, as expected. The age is also useful as suspected, but is the second most useful and not the fifth. The education level is not selected, but the numerical version of this feature, 'education-num', is. I believe that because this feature gives an order to the different education levels, it is more easily undertood by the model ans thus selected over the categorical version of that feature. Capital loss is also selected as one of the most important features, because it works the same as capital-gain : an individual that looses capital is very likely to have a small income. At last, the number of hours of work by week seems more relevant than the occupation and the workclass. It is understandable, as a well paying job is likely to requieres a lot of work.\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "If our model is really time consuming and we need to train it often, il can be a good idea to use the reduced data. But in this problem, the training time is really nothing compared to the time needed to send letters to the potential donators for instance, so we should not trade of performance for training time. In addition to this, the census data are not released often, so it does not make sense to believe that we will have to train this model often."
